# Issues: 
- Cannot get rid of the blue border on the navbar dropdown icon when it is clicked
cannot cause the fusion dragon logo and name to shrink. this causes the navbar to break when below 445px
menu button doesnt change border back to original until clicked off of on mobile version

- Used an old version of bootstrap initially (ver4.1), this led to several issues in regards to making the 
new Bootstrap code work within our website.

- The team had some early issues with getting Gitpod to properly merge our work together on Github which caused some 
loss of code.

- Flexbox proved to be very tempremental when it came to the design of the website, a greater emphisis on using rows and columns 
rather than flexbox will be useful in future.

- The footer would often jump up and cover up words and images before we managed to fix it in place.

- We started working on the website without fully considering the mobile first development stratagy.

- Some overlap of text and header/footer

- Social links not working as there is no dedicated pages to link them to.

- Forgot to ensure some images had a - between each word. This was corrected at the last minute.



# Roadmap

- Add more recipes to the website.

- Have reviews of our recipes, so people can rate them.

- Make a carousel of featured recipes that changes every month.

- Have a link to well known suppliers of authentic ingrediats that can be used to make our dishes.

- Make a more intricate Home page
